Google homepage

This is my version of the Google Homepage project from The Odin Project.  

Started: 3 October 2020  
Finished: ver.1 4 October 2020  

Things I learned:  
    1. Don't try to get fancy at first. Do all of the html structure before the CSS.  
    2. Multiple cursors are wonderful!! (Alt+right-click in VS Code)  
    3. When you have an error and don't know where it's from, sometimes it saves a lot of headaches to just start over with a clear document.  

Things I'm still fuzzy on:  
    1. How do I get my footer to extend all the way to the bottom??  
    2. Why is my footer's grid not working right? I believe I have the code right, but the "Privacy" word keeps going away from the "privacy" grid area and I don't know why.  
    3. How do I add the little icons into the search bar? I tried to add them as background, before I just scrapped it and restarted, but couldn't figure out how to make it work right..  

Suffice to say, I learned a whole ton and now know several tons more that I don't yet know.  

If anyone has any advice for fixing some of the stylistic elements, please please please let me know! I've searched enough to know that I probably just don't know how to word my issues right, so I would like outside assistance to find my answers.
